# beer-stock-api
This project is part of bootcamp at Digital Innovation One in partnership with Everis . So through it I learned to test, unitarily, a REST API for beer stock management.The application was developed in Spring Boot and I also used the main concepts of unit testing with JUnit and Mockito.
